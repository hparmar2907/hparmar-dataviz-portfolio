# Harnoor Parmar  
### Telling Stories with Data Portfolio | Carnegie Mellon University  

Welcome to my data visualization portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data course at CMU.  
Here, I’ve shared projects that explore how design, storytelling, and analytics come together to make data meaningful.

# About me
Hi! I’m Harnoor Parmar (she/her), a graduate student in Information Systems Management at Carnegie Mellon University. I’m interested in how technology, data, and storytelling come together to create real impact.

Before CMU, I worked as a Software Developer at BlackRock, building backend systems that supported large-scale data workflows. These days, I’m exploring how data visualization can make complex ideas more intuitive and engaging. When I’m not working with data, you’ll probably find me on a walk around Schenley Park or experimenting with new coffee blends.

# What I hope to learn
Through this course, I want to get better at using data visualization to tell clear and meaningful stories. I’m especially interested in how thoughtful design choices can make complex information easier to understand and more impactful for different audiences. I’d love to explore new tools and techniques that help bridge the gap between analysis and communication.

After I graduate, I plan to work in a **technical or data-focused role** where I can combine my background in software engineering with my growing interest in analytics and visualization. My goal is to keep building tools and systems that help people make better, data-driven decisions — and hopefully, make technology feel a bit more human in the process.

## Assignment: [Visualizing Government Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
This project explores how government debt has evolved across countries over time and how design choices shape public understanding of economic data. I analyzed different ways to visualize debt-to-GDP ratios and created a clear, data-driven graphic that highlights key trends and regional contrasts while maintaining visual balance and interpretability.

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
In this project, I analyzed a NOAA climate visualization on greenhouse gas trends, critiquing it for clarity, accessibility, and design effectiveness. Using those insights, I created an interactive redesign where users can click any year to compare changes, view percentage shifts, and explore how different gases have evolved over time. The project focuses on improving data storytelling through thoughtful color, interaction, and usability choices. 

## Final project
This section will include my work for the final project in Telling Stories with Data.

Here are the parts I’ll be adding as I go: 
[Part I](final-project-part-one)
[Part II](final-project-part-two)
[Part III](final-project-part-three)
