# Harnoor Parmar  
### Telling Stories with Data Portfolio | Carnegie Mellon University  

Welcome to my data visualization portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data course at CMU.  
Here, I’ve shared projects that explore how design, storytelling, and analytics come together to make data meaningful.

# About me
Hi! I’m Harnoor Parmar (she/her), a graduate student in Information Systems Management at Carnegie Mellon University. I’m interested in how technology, data, and storytelling come together to create real impact.

Before CMU, I worked as a Software Developer at BlackRock, building backend systems that supported large-scale data workflows. These days, I’m exploring how data visualization can make complex ideas more intuitive and engaging. When I’m not working with data, you’ll probably find me on a walk around Schenley Park or experimenting with new coffee blends.

# What I hope to learn
Through this course, I want to get better at using data visualization to tell clear and meaningful stories. I’m especially interested in how thoughtful design choices can make complex information easier to understand and more impactful for different audiences. I’d love to explore new tools and techniques that help bridge the gap between analysis and communication.

After I graduate, I plan to work in a **technical or data-focused role** where I can combine my background in software engineering with my growing interest in analytics and visualization. My goal is to keep building tools and systems that help people make better, data-driven decisions — and hopefully, make technology feel a bit more human in the process.

## Assignment: [Visualizing overnment Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
This section will include my work for the final project in Telling Stories with Data.

Here are the parts I’ll be adding as I go: 
[Part I](final-project-part-one)
[Part II](final-project-part-two)
[Part III](final-project-part-three)

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
