# Outline
College affordability is often discussed strictly in terms of tuition, but the lived financial reality for students is shaped far more by everyday expenses—housing, food, textbooks, transportation, and part-time wages. My project aims to tell a clear, data-driven story about how the overall cost of being a college student has evolved over the past decade, and how those shifts quietly affect students’ choices, stress levels, and academic life.

Rather than creating a dashboard of disconnected charts, my goal is to build a narrative that helps the audience feel the financial pressure through the combination of numbers, comparisons, and human-centered design. The project will highlight which categories are rising fastest, where regional differences matter, and how student earnings have not kept pace. Ultimately, this story is meant to help students, families, and educators understand where the real strain lies—and why it matters.

## Storyline
Student living costs have risen faster and less predictably than tuition, creating financial pressure that most people do not see.

## User Stories
- As a current student, I want to understand why my cost of living feels so high, so that I can make informed decisions about work, housing, and budgeting.

- As a prospective student or parent, I want to know what expenses to expect beyond tuition so that I’m not surprised later.

- As a university staff member, I want to see which categories strain students the most so that campus support programs can be better designed.
