## Overview

This write-up documents how my final data story,
From Stability to Strain: How Rising Costs Are Outpacing Student Earnings,
evolved during Part III of the project. Rather than repeating work from Parts I and II, this section explains how earlier sketches, datasets, user interviews, and design tests informed the final version of the story. It also highlights the revisions I made, the audience I designed for, and the choices that shaped the final Shorthand narrative.

# Changes made since Part II
Moving into Part III, my focus shifted from assembling visualizations to shaping a cohesive story. I had initially collected several datasets — housing CPI, food CPI, tuition averages, and student earnings — but the narrative still needed stronger pacing and clearer transitions. Part III became the stage where I organized these elements and made the story easier to follow.

1. Tightening the Story Structure

Feedback showed that the narrative worked best when following a clear progression:

- rising day-to-day costs,

- rising education costs,

- the widening gap between expenses and earnings.

Reworking the structure around these three chapters made the story feel more intentional and easier to grasp.

2. Turning Charts Into Explanations

Earlier drafts relied heavily on visuals with long paragraphs of text beside them. In Part III, I trimmed down explanations and allowed captions, brief definitions, and annotations to do the heavy lifting. This helped keep the pacing smooth in Shorthand.

3. Improving Clarity

Some terms, especially economic language such as CPI, needed small definitions. Small additions like this helped the story remain accessible to readers without a background in economics.

## Audience: Who the Story Is For
The project is designed for:

- current college students,

- recent graduates, and

- young adults preparing for higher education.

These are individuals directly affected by shifts in wages, inflation, and tuition costs. To better understand this group, I developed three personas during Part III:
a current student balancing work and expenses, a recent graduate repaying loans, and a prospective student evaluating affordability. These personas helped test whether the story addressed the questions and concerns that matter most to them. This audience is directly impacted by rising living and education costs, so designing a story that is clear, relatable, and easy to understand was essential to ensuring the insights were meaningful for them.

### User Research Insights

I walked individuals through my storyboards and early draft charts. Each person fit the demographics I was targeting. Their feedback was helpful in refining the flow and sharpening parts of the narrative.

### Key Observations

- The CPI charts were intuitive and immediately relatable.

- The earnings-vs-cost chart had the strongest emotional impact.

- Several people wanted more context behind the tuition numbers.

- Some transitions felt abrupt and needed smoother framing.

- Condensed call-out text worked better than long explanations.

### Adjustments Based on Their Feedback

User interviews, persona development, and early storyboard reviews helped me refine my narrative and make the visual story clearer and more relevant for students and young adults. Based on this feedback, I made several focused updates:

- Added short definitions (like CPI) directly under charts to reduce confusion.

- Reordered the narrative to follow a natural progression: living costs → college costs → the financial gap.

- Strengthened transitions between sections so the story feels continuous rather than segmented.

- Added concise annotations and call-outs to highlight important insights without long explanations.

- Clarified why NCES tuition averages appear lower than typical tuition “sticker prices.”

- Simplified long paragraphs into shorter, more readable pieces.

- Refined the final call-to-action slide to offer practical next steps for colleges and institutions.

Overall, these changes helped make the story more grounded, easier to follow, and directly aligned with what my audience said they needed.

## Reflection

Working through Part III gave me a deeper appreciation for how data stories evolve. A strong narrative is not just a collection of charts; it is the result of careful decisions about pacing, emphasis, audience needs, and visual clarity. The combination of interviews, personas, and design iteration helped turn the original idea into something more focused and meaningful. I intentionally used simple, muted colors and direct on-chart annotations to keep the visualizations easy to interpret and to ensure the focus stayed on the trends rather than on decorative elements.

This stage also reinforced how important it is to balance data with real-world context. Rising costs and stagnant earnings are not just economic concepts — they affect day-to-day choices and long-term opportunities for students. Keeping this human perspective in mind shaped the way the final story reads.

# Final thoughts
This project ended up teaching me far more than I expected. I started with a simple idea — show how student costs are rising — but turning it into a clear and meaningful story took a surprising amount of iteration. User interviews, personas, and early sketches helped me realize how important it is to focus on what actually matters to students, not just what looks good in a chart.

I didn’t get to explore everything I hoped to, but I’m proud of how the narrative came together. If I had more time, I’d dig deeper into financial aid trends and regional differences, since affordability varies so much by place. The biggest thing I learned is that good visual storytelling is less about the visuals and more about empathy — helping people understand an issue in a way that feels real and relatable.

Overall, I genuinely enjoyed building this project and seeing how each piece connected to the next. It was challenging, but in the best way.
