# From Stability to Strain: How Rising Costs Are Outpacing Student Earnings

# Storyboards
When I began this project, my initial goal was straightforward: I wanted to compare how much housing costs had changed over time. But after classroom feedback and the critique-by-design exercise, it became clear that the story wasn’t just about housing or inflation—it was about something deeper and more relatable. Students today are facing a widening financial gap where the cost of simply existing (rent, food, tuition) is rising much faster than what they earn.

This realization shifted the entire scope of the project. Instead of looking at isolated datasets, I expanded the analysis to include housing CPI, food CPI, tuition costs, and student earnings. Bringing these datasets together allowed me to tell a fuller, more honest story of the student financial reality today—one where budgets are tighter, trade-offs are harsher, and affordability is becoming increasingly out of reach.

The structure of the storyboard follows this progression:

Start with cost-of-living pressures — showing how basic necessities like housing have risen year after year.

Layer in tuition costs — revealing how education affordability has changed in the same timeframe.

Contrast both with student earnings — highlighting the imbalance between rising expenses and stagnant wage growth.

This narrative shift allowed me to move beyond simply describing what costs look like, and instead begin exploring why students feel more financially strained today, even compared with just ten years ago. It also helped uncover a core insight: the issue isn’t just inflation—it’s that income is not keeping pace.

Ultimately, this project is not only about numbers. It’s about understanding the student experience in a landscape where everything feels more expensive except the one thing students rely on the most: their paycheck. A chart about CPI becomes a chart about affordability. A line showing tuition becomes a line showing the trade-off between education and financial stress. And when viewed together, the story becomes clearer: today’s students are being financially outpaced by their environment.

I will use this storyboard as the foundation for my Part III draft in Shorthand, where I will refine the narrative, integrate the Tableau visualizations, and strengthen the overall flow and clarity.
